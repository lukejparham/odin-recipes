            <img src="../images/tacos.jpg" alt="tacos image" height="310" width="310"> 
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These delicious tacos are easy to make and topped with cilantro and onions. I serve them with guacamole, salsa and fresh lime wedges on the side.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound seasoned, boneless, skinless chicken</li>
                <li>1 onion, diced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
                <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat corn tortillas until soft and pliable in the microwave, about 1 minute. Top with chicken, onions, and cilantro.</li>
            </ol>
